What is a Web App?

A web app is a client–server computer program in which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, online auctions, wikis, instant messaging services and many other functions.

How are new web browser features proposed?

They are created and adopted usually as part of web standaards, which are rules and guidelines published by standards bodies that are designed to promote consistency in the behavior of web browsers. Once the standard has reached a "reccomendation" status, they are usually quickly implemented into major browsers.
