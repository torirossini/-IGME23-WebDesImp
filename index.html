            <p>Hello hello! I'm Tori, a second-year Game Design and Development major, and the Social Director of Computer Science House. I can't tell you how many HTML homepages I've made by now with a "short bio about yourself", so here's a nice abbreviated version.</p>
            <p>I enjoy making and playing games. I came to RIT with a background in programming, and a passion for art and games. I'm definetely considering becoming a technical artist. I want to work for a large game studio at first, moving my way closer to indie as I gain experience. I hope to learn how to make web apps in this class, so I can make web services for CSH.</p>
            <p>Here's a picture of me in Harmonix Studios elevator lobby!</p>
