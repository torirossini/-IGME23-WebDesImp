## Story
* I'm thinking that the story is that you're playing as a man (I'm thinking like, a neckbeard maybe.) trying to impress the girl of your dreams by pulling off epic fedora tricks.
* Emotions I want to drive include:
	* Excitement
	* Determination
	* Joy (It's supposed to be _funny._)
* Level-based, progress through the game and earn points. If you earn enough points by certain milestones, maybe she'll fall for you. If you don't ain enough points in X amount of levels, she finds another man who can fedora flip better than you.

## Aesthetics
* Stick figure, line art
* Omage to older games like Line Rider
